	  <h3><strong>Hey, I'm Sana :) </strong></h3>
	  <h4>I am a product manager interested in the intersection of tech, diversity, and education. Currently, I am a PM on the <a href="http://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a> team at Microsoft. I get to experience first-hand how customer-driven engineering powers open-source projects.</h4>
		<h4>I'm passionate about democratizing education by leveraging technology. I firmly believe that everyone should have equal access to education, no matter their background or location.</h4>
		<h4>I'm also deeply interested in community building, having organized TEDx conferences at my alma mater, Georgia Tech. I am looking for cool, community-driven events and ways to get involved in Seattle.</h4>	
		<h4>Outside of the office, I like reading, comedy shows, being active (running, soccer, hiking), and trying out new cooking recipes. Check out my personal blog or hit me up on <a href="http://twitter.com/{{ site.twitter }}">Twitter</a>.</h4>
