	  <h3><strong>Hey there! My name's Sana.</strong></h3>
	  <h4>I am a product manager interested in the intersection of tech, diversity, and education. Currently, I am a PM at Microsoft on the VS Code and TypeScript team.</h4>
		<h4>I'm passionate about democratizing education by leveraging technology. I firmly believe that everyone should have equal access to education, no matter their background or location.</h4>
		<h4>I'm also deeply interested in community building, having organized TEDx conferences at my alma mater, Georgia Tech, and am looking for cool opportunities in Seattle.</h4>	
		<h4>Outside of the office, I like reading, comedy shows, being active (running, soccer, hiking), and drinking coffee. Check out my personal blog or <a href="http://twitter.com/{{ site.twitter }}">Twitter</a> for more into the life of a curious and optimistic girl learning how to live a meaningful #adult life.</h4>
